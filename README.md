BrightTV ‘s CEO has an objective to grow the company’s subscription base for this financial year.
For this project, I have provided insights that would assist CVM (Customer Value Management) team in achieving their 2025 objective.

The dataset attached contains information on the user profiles and viewer transactions for BrightTV. These tables have been combined on a full outer join, to retrieve all information from both tables without omitting the other.

The project answers the following questions:
- Provide insights on user and usage trends of BrightTV.
- What type of factors influence consumption? 
- What content would you recommend to increase consumption on the days with low consumption? 
- What type of initiatives would you recommend to further grow BrightTV ‘s User base?

The following tools have been utilised:
- Excel
- SQL (Snowflake)
